		<h3 id="applicationStructure"><strong>A) Application Structure</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>This application is built up around the CodeIgniter framework. This framework is freely available on the internet and documentation for using the source code can be founded on their website: <a href="http://ellislab.com/codeigniter">http://ellislab.com/codeigniter</a>. CodeIgniter is a PHP Framework written in MVC (model-view-controller) format which allows developers to create applications that are structured in a very clean and efficient way. When you unzip the PROMS Code download  (<b>PROMS1.x/code</b>), you will be presented with the following directory structure. Below is a quick overview where you can find various files if you are new to using CodeIgniter.</p>
		
		<img src="assets/images/directory_structure.png" alt="Directory Structure" />
		
		<p>
		<ul>
		<li><b>application</b> - This is where the main application files are kept. It includes the configuaration files, the class controllers, models and view files. If you want to make changes to the application, you should modify these files.</li>
		<li><b>public/assets</b> - Custom CSS, Javascripts, Images used in the application are stored here.</li>
		<li><b>avatars</b> - This folder is used to store user profile photo. </li>
		<li><b>files</b> - This folder is used to store user uploads. </li>
		<li><b>system</b> - The core CodeIgniter files are present here. These should not be modified unless upgrading the CodeIgniter version.</li>
		<li><b>.htaccess</b> - This file is used to tell your web server to process friendly URLs.</li>
		<li><b>index.php</b> - The application bootup file.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>

		<p>You can find more information on directory structure at the CodeIgniter website and reading the User Guide: <a href="http://ellislab.com/codeigniter/user-guide/">http://ellislab.com/codeigniter/user-guide/</a>.

		<h3 id="install"><strong>B) Setup And Installation</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<h4>Server Requirements</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Apache with PHP and MySQL server</li>
			<li>
				PHP v7.0+</li>
			<li>
				MySqli</li>
			<li>
				CURL Enabled</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Quick Installation Guide</h4>

		<p>Once you have downloaded your file from the Envato Marketplace, you will need to extract the files from the ZIP file (PROMS/code) and upload them so that these files are in your main directory on your webserver, usually this is the public_html folder. Your webserver's main directory should look something like this:		</p> 

		<img src="assets/images/directory_structure.png" alt="Directory Structure" />

		<p>Before you can use your PROMS, you will need to edit the config files. First locate the config file in: <b>application/config/config.php</b> and open it up using a text editor such as notepad. The only line you should need to edit is the:

		<pre>$config['base_url']	= 'http://www.example.com/';</pre>

		Replace the http://www.example.com with your own domain name, making sure you keep the quotation tags around it as above. There are some other settings that you can also edit in this file if you feel the need to customise your PROMS further but for a basic installation this is all you should need to edit. Save the file and overwrite the existing one on your webserver.
		</p>

		<p>The second file you will need to edit is your database file. Find the file: <b>application/config/database.php</b> and open it up using a text editor like Notepad. You will need to edit the lines listed below with your own database login information. For the most part, host stays the same as localhost unless your web host specifies to you otherwise. You will need your database name, database username and database password.

		<pre>$db['default']['hostname'] = 'localhost';
$db['default']['username'] = 'your_username';
$db['default']['password'] = 'your_password';
$db['default']['database'] = 'database_name';
		</pre>

		Once you have modified this file, save it and overwrite the existing one on your webserver.
		</p>

		<p>Next you will need to execute the SQL file that came with the PROMS download. This file will create the database tables that are used to store the data of your application. Usually you can import the SQL tables by using a database management system like PHPmyAdmin. The SQL file is located in (<b>PROMS1.x/database/database.sql</b>).</p>

		<p>To Import the file, login to your database management system, such as PHPmyAdmin. Make sure you are on the database that you named in the database.php config file then locate the Import Tab on PHPmyAdmin.</p>

		<img src="assets/images/database_import.png" alt="Database Import" />

		<p>Next select the browse button (as shown in the screenshot above) and locate the SQL file <b>database.sql</b>. Next click the Go! button and you should now see database tables appear in the left sidebar.</p>

		<img src="assets/images/database_tables.png" alt="Database Tables" />

		<p>Finally, when you run your application (<b>http://www.mydomain.com/</b>) in your web browser. You will be redirected automatically to <b>http://www.mydomain.com/install/</b> where mydomain.com is replaced by your own. On the Install Page, you will need to create the owner account which will have all the privleges for managing the PROMS. </p>

		<img src="assets/images/installation.png" alt="Installation" />

		<p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> Once you have installed the PROMS, please delete the file <b>application/controllers/install.php</b> and <b>application/views/install/</b> folder. This will prevent other users from messing up your settings.</p>

		<p><b>INSTALLING IN A SUB-FOLDER</b></p>
		<p>If you're installing the software in a sub-folder, such as http://www.example.com/proms/ then you will need to modify the .htaccess file inside the main directory (the one that holds the application, bootstrap folders etc). All you need to do is open up the .htaccess file in your text editor and copy the following code, replacing the sub-folder with the name of your sub-folder (in this example, the sub-folder is called project_box. Replace this with the name of your sub-folder).</p>

		<p>
		<pre>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /proms
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*) index.php?/$1 
		</pre>
		</p>

		<p>Save the file as .htaccess and overwrite the one inside your main directory that you used to install the software in (the folder containing the application, bootstrap folders etc). You can skip this step if you're installing in your main folder.

		<h3 id="quick"><strong>C) Where Everything Is</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		
		<p>This part of the guide is to show you where the most common elements of the site are located. Remember, this site uses CodeIgniter Framework, so for well-documented additional support, please use their website and user guide: <a href="http://ellislab.com/codeigniter/user-guide/">http://ellislab.com/codeigniter/user-guide/</a></p>

		<p>The site's styling is based off Bootstrap 3; Bootstrap 3 comes with lots of predefined CSS elements that you can use to create well presented websites with. You can view the Bootstrap documentation and examples here: <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">http://getbootstrap.com/</a>.</p>

		<p>The template files, also known as views, can be found in <b>application/views/</b>. These files contain the HTML of the site and modifying these files allows you to change the way the site presents data. These files also contain some PHP code so it's important to know what you're doing when editting these files. The layout file can be found in <b>application/views/dashboard.php</b>.</p>

		<p>The controller files, which contain the site logic, can be found in <b>application/controllers/</b> folder. These are PHP files that are used to control how the site works.</p>

		<p>The model files can be found in <b>application/models/</b> which contain the database logic.</p>

		<p>The Javascript files can be found in the  <b>public/assets/js</b>/. folder.</p>
